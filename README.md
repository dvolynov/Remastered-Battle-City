Remastered Battle City is a project that pays homage to the classic game "Battle City." As a passionate programmer, I embarked on a mission to recreate this beloved game and enhance its gameplay experience.

## Background

I initially developed the game in 2019 as a personal project. It started as a single, monolithic file with around 1500 lines of code. Although it was far from optimized, slow, and resource-heavy, I was proud of my early achievement as it showcased my programming skills at the time.

## Evolution and Refinement

Over time, as my programming competencies grew, I dedicated myself to improving the game. I introduced graphics, implemented more complex mechanics, and even added multiplayer functionality. However, the turning point came when I learned about object-oriented programming.

Inspired by this concept, I decided to rewrite the game from scratch, focusing on the simplest element: the sprite. With each class and additional method added to the sprite, the game's structure evolved and became more organized. This modular design allowed for seamless integration of new objects and laid the foundation for an ideal game structure.

## Artificial Intelligence Integration

In 2022, I delved into the world of artificial intelligence and saw an opportunity to enhance the gameplay even further. I introduced intelligent bots with their own unique AI, creating engaging and challenging experiences for players. The integration of AI technology took the game to new heights.

## Future Plans

The journey doesn't end here. I have ambitious plans for Remastered Battle City. I aim to incorporate network multiplayer functionality, enabling players to compete against each other online. Additionally, I have plans to develop a mobile version of the game, reaching a wider audience.

Throughout the development process, I have embraced new technologies and learned valuable lessons. This project has allowed me to refine my programming skills and explore my passion for game design.
